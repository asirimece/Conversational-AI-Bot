# Conversational-AI-Bot

## Overview
This project is an AI-powered chatbot capable of responding to **SPARQL queries** and **natural language queries** related to movies. The chatbot provides movie recommendations based on a **knowledge graph** and **crowd-sourced data**, leveraging AI-driven natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

## Features
- **SPARQL Query Handling**: Allows users to make structured SPARQL queries to retrieve information from a movie knowledge graph.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Supports natural language queries, making it easier for users to interact with the system without needing technical knowledge of SPARQL.
- **Movie Recommendations**: Provides personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences, leveraging both a movie knowledge graph and crowd-sourced data.
- **Knowledge Graph Integration**: Uses a movie knowledge graph to find connections between movies, actors, directors, and genres for tailored recommendations.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For implementing the chatbot logic and integrating natural language processing.
- **SPARQL**: For querying the movie knowledge graph.
- **NLP**: For understanding and processing natural language queries.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: For generating personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences.

This bot runs on Speakeasy infrastructure.
