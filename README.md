# Conversational-AI-Bot

## Overview
This project is an AI-driven chatbot designed to seamlessly handle both SPARQL queries and natural language inputs, offering a highly interactive and intuitive experience for movie enthusiasts. The chatbot taps into a rich movie **knowledge graph** combined with **crowd-sourced data** to deliver tailored movie recommendations. By leveraging **natural language processing** (NLP) techniques and **graph-based data retrieval**, the system provides accurate and **context-aware recommendations** while allowing users to query detailed movie-related information.

## Features
- **SPARQL Query Handling**: Allows users to make structured SPARQL queries to retrieve information from a movie knowledge graph.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Supports natural language queries, making it easier for users to interact with the system without needing technical knowledge of SPARQL.
- **Movie Recommendations**: Provides personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences, leveraging both a movie knowledge graph and crowd-sourced data.
- **Knowledge Graph Integration**: Uses a movie knowledge graph to find connections between movies, actors, directors, and genres for tailored recommendations.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For implementing the chatbot logic and integrating natural language processing.
- **SPARQL**: For querying the movie knowledge graph.
- **NLP**: For understanding and processing natural language queries.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: For generating personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences, enriching the recommendation logic with context-aware suggestions.
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Utilizes a graph database to represent and explore complex relationships between movies, actors, genres, and directors.

This bot runs on Speakeasy infrastructure.
